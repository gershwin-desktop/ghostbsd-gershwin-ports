Workspace is the official Gershwin workspace manager. It is fork of GWorkspace
which is a clone of NeXT's workspace manager. Workspace is probably one of the
most useful and usable workspace managers available on any platform, owing to
its well-designed interface and the natural, consistent design that it inherits
from the GNUstep framework.
